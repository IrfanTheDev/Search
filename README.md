# Search 
Design a front-end for Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search.

## Overview
Search is the zeroth project for Harvard CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course. The project specifications are listed [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/0/search/).

## Project Demos
A [full demo of my project](https://youtu.be/41f2yAE5AAw) can be viewed on YouTube along with my all [other CS50 Web Projects](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6kIwIV_2O_gfcx46gplsaybo8c9vTb3d).
